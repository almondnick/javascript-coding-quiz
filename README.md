## Usage

Users can start the quiz by clicking on "Start Quiz" and they will be directed to a page with a question, 4 multiple choice options, and a timer. There are 4 questions. Simply click on whichever option you think is correct and the application will display if you are "Wrong" or "Correct". After you have completed the quiz, a screen will show your score (the time remaining on the timer + any penalties) and an input box where you can type your name. Once you have typed your name, click "Submit" to send your score to the high scores page. Click "View High Scores" to see all scores submitted. The application stores previous scores using local storage and you can clear the scores page at any time using the "Clear High Scores" button. If you'd like to restart, click the "Restart" button and you will be directed back to the main page.
